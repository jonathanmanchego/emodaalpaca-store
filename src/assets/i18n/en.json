    "description": "Our entrepreneurship in the textile sector was born in 2003, Oscar and I created Milagros crafts from which our first products went to the local market. As a result of our experience we started our own identity, in 2011 we created EMODA ALPACAS EIRL, a name made up of the initials of the names of our family, our first participation in Peru Moda in the same year gave us the vision to position our brand and our products nationally and internationally."
